Haxe is an opensource multiplatform programming language.

What is NME?
NME is a free, open-source framework that enables development for iOS, Android, webOS, BlackBerry, Windows, Mac, Linux and Flash Player from a single codebase. Unlike most cross-platform frameworks, NME applications are not written in a low-level language (like C or C++) and does not require a virtual machine or runtime (like Java and Adobe AIR) in order to run on a target platform.

From Flint's website:

Flint is an open-source project to create a versatile particle system in Actionscript 3. The aim is to create a system that handles the common functionality for all particle systems, has methods for common particle behaviour, and lets developers extend it easily with their own custom behaviours without needing to touch the core code.

Flint is developed by Richard Lord. Flintâ€™s integration with 3D rendering libraries is developed by Richard Lord and Michael Ivanov. Flint is released under the MIT open source licence.
